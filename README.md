# Work Environment Config Guide
Configuration/Resources for my work environment in Linux

## Requirements
A Linux based system is required. If you have windows you can use WSL2.

### Optional: Install WSL2

Open a Windows PowerShell terminal and enter:
```shell
wsl --install
```

## Terminals
There are many terminals. My current recomendation is `WezTerm`

### WezTerm
WezTerm is a powerful cross-platform terminal emulator and multiplexer implemented in Rust.

>[!NOTE]
> The following steps are to install and configure it for Windows. You can see different steps in the oficial documentation [WezTerm Docs](https://wezterm.org/installation.html) 

You can download the `.exe` in this link:  [Windows WezTerm](https://wezterm.org/install/windows.html)

Once installed, copy the `.wexterm.lua` file into `C:\Users\your-username` to have the same configuration. You can personalize it as your wills.

### Windows Terminal
Install the ***Windows Terminal*** app available in Microsoft Store.

You can custimize it with the graphical interface.
